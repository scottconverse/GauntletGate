# GauntletGate report — Acme Notes — Sprint 7 → Sprint 8

**Date:** 2026-06-17 · **Build/commit:** `a1b9f0c` · **Run by:** GauntletGate (all)
**Lanes run:** lite, walkthrough, full · **Lanes NOT run:** —
**How run / environment:** local — `npm run dev` on a fresh, isolated profile (see attestation)

> Illustrative example of a clean full run. Numbers/findings are representative.

---

## Verdict (read first)

> **✅ CLEAR TO ADVANCE**

- **First-run:** reaches core feature ✅ — (first-run coverage: **VALID**)
- **Severity roll-up (lanes run):** Blocker 0 · Critical 0 · Major 2 · Minor 5 · Nit 3
- **One-line why:** a brand-new user with no account and an empty database completes the core flow (create → save → reload-persists); the two Majors are non-blocking and go to the watchlist.

## Environment provisioning — verified (attestation)

| What | State used | How VERIFIED — not assumed |
|---|---|---|
| Profile / app-data isolation | temp `$HOME` (`/tmp/gg-XXXX`) | confirmed app wrote `~/.config/acme/first-run.json` under the temp HOME, not the real one (`artifacts/isolation-path.txt`) |
| First-run flags | unset | the first-run marker did not exist at launch; created during the run |
| External dependency: Postgres | **ABSENT** then present | absent: container stopped (`docker ps` empty); present: started for the returning-user pass |
| Data store | empty | fresh DB volume; `SELECT count(*)` = 0 at start |
| Network | online | — |

**Isolation verified?** YES · **First-run coverage:** VALID
**Evidence artifacts (required):** `artifacts/first-run-empty.png`, `artifacts/isolation-path.txt`, `artifacts/db-absent-banner.png`, `artifacts/playwright-trace.zip`

## Lane results

### Lite
TL;DR: ship. 0 Blocker/Critical on the sprint's diff; first-run surface unaffected by the changes. No escalation triggered (fed into the full run below).

### Walkthrough
First-run verdict: reaches core feature ✅. Matrix cells: first-run×DB-absent×empty×online (graceful "starting database…" state, then guided), first-run×DB-present×empty×online (core flow completes), returning×present×populated×online. No dead-ends. 5 Minor / 3 Nit (copy, spacing, one aria-label).

### Full
Per-role roll-up: Engineering 0/0/1 · UI/UX 0/0/1 · Writer 0/0/0 · Test 0/0/0 · QA 0/0/0 (+ minors/nits). Consumed the Walkthrough report (did not re-walk the UI). Two Majors:

- **ENG-Major-1** — N+1 query on the notes-list endpoint (watchlist; not user-visible at current scale).
- **UX-Major-1** — empty-state copy on the search screen is unhelpful across two surfaces.

No cross-role Blocker/Critical. Deep-dives: `01-engineering` … `05-qa`.

---

## Blocking punch list (must clear to advance)
None. (0 Blocker / 0 Critical.)

## Next-stage watchlist
| ID | Title | Severity | Owner | Note |
|----|-------|----------|-------|------|
| ENG-Major-1 | N+1 on notes-list | Major | Engineering | fix before scale; not acute |
| UX-Major-1 | unhelpful empty-state copy (search) | Major | UI/UX | cheap copy fix |

## What's working (credited, specific)
- First-run with an absent database degrades gracefully ("starting database…") instead of dead-ending — the exact thing a dev box would have hidden.
- Auth boundary held under the QA role's IDOR probing; created notes persist across reload and across a second tab.

## Sign-off checklist
- [x] Verdict matches lanes run (walkthrough + full ran → eligible for CLEAR; 0 Blocker/0 Critical).
- [x] Attestation filled with verified facts + linked artifacts.
- [x] First-run reachability stated (✅ reaches core feature).
- [x] All 5 roles ran; deep-dives exist; cross-role findings checked (none Blocker/Critical).
- [x] Every finding has evidence + fix path; Majors have blast radius.
- [x] What's-working present.
